		<div class="description">Hello, World! This is my first project for Udacity. So, last summer, I checked out the amazing <strong>Rain Room</strong> at the <em>Museum of Modern Art</em> in NYC. You enter a room with a field of falling water which pauses wherever a human body is detected, offering visitors the experience of controlling the rain. The work invites visitors to explore the roles that science, technology, and human ingenuity can play in stabilizing our environment. Using digital technology, <strong>Rain Room</strong> creates a carefully choreographed downpour, simultaneously encouraging people to become performers on an unexpected stage and creating an intimate atmosphere of contemplation.
